<li/>Corrected free models not counting "O" when reloading list
<li/>Correcting tier free models : applying "free model" on previously selected models when unlocking the level

<li/>Adding theme force from Exigence for minions (Helga, Jaga)
<li/>Adding theme force : Dr. Arkadius - Nature of the Beast (NQ56) (including Gorax Guest Star)

<b>1.5</b><br>
<ul>
<li/>Armies, battles and result files are now saved in sdcard/whac/
<li/>So, you can now handle your armies : copy/cut/paste/transfer/sync files outside of WHAC
<li/>A lot of correction for theme forces : not only have most tiers for Warmachine be corrected from previous errors,  
but they also now provide the bonus text. Also, there is some new theme forces available.
<li/>The theme forces now can handle "textual" description of limitations, so you will get something like "non character warjacks" instead of
the complete list of warjacks available.
<li/>And, you can import theme forces files, so you can get new themes and/or corrections the same ways you do with cards.
<li/>You can now save many battle results with the same army list (same list played against various opponents)
<li/>Last, but not least : you can add cards in battle mode (hello popping shredders!) : find the card in the library, then long-press to add to your troops.
