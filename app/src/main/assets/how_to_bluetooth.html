<h1>Bluetooth how-to</h1>

<h2>First step</h2>

<ul>
<li>Both player must be on THIS screen. This does not work if your opponent is still on the "battle" screen.
<li>Only ONE player gets to click on its opponent device name to start the communication.
<li>Once the devices are connected, this screen will close and return to battle screen.
</ul>

<h2>Discovering opponents</h2>

<ul>
<li>If you have already paired your opponent's device someday, it appears in the list. It does NOT mean that this device is currently
online.
<li>If you have never paired with your opponent, you have to make ONE device discoverable, THEN start a discovery with the other device. 
<li>The discovery process will scan, this may take UP TO 12 seconds. Be patient.
<li>Once discovered, you can click on your opponent's device name, this will start the pairing process (which you must accept), THEN the devices will exchange army lists
</ul>
 
<h2>Battle mode</h2>

<ul>
<li>Once connected, the connection is maintained until one player leaves the battle screen (=end battle)
<li>The devices exchange army lists and create a "player 2" tab with the opponent's list. Each player is "player 1" on its own device. 
<li>When a player registers damages ON ITS OWN damage grids, the damages are transmitted to the opponent. If you register damages on you opponent's grids, they are not
transmitted : each player is responsible of its cards.
<li>The chronometer is synchronized between devices, BUT it only sends "play/pause" events. Make sure before connecting via bluetooth that both player have configured the same initial time 
and that the chrono is paused.
<li>In case the connection is lost or broken, you have to re-init it via the bluetooth menu. This has to be done on both devices.
</ul>
