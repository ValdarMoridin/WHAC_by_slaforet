<h1>Importing data how-to</h1>

<h2>From a computer</h2>

<ul>
<li>please visit  <a href="http://whac.forumactif.org/">http://whac.forumactif.org/</a> on your computer
<li>In order to access data files, you have to register on the forum!
<li>Download a data file on your computer 
<li>Copy the file on your device (USB, wifi...) in the Whac file of your SD Card
<li>The file should be visible in the import screen. You may have to exit/reload this screen to refresh the SD content
<li>Click on the import icon next to the file name.
</ul>

<h2>Updating data files</h2>
<li>Once imported, the data files are copied from the SD card to an "internal" directory. The content of this
directory is loaded at startup, and overwrite the basic data
<li>If you import new data files for the same armies, there might be many files containing the same entries with different
name. To avoid this
it is recommended that you DELETE the imported files before importing new files. 
<li>To make sure only the latest datafiles are used, you may have to force WHAC to close and restart (via "double tap" on home button or 
the "list application" button, depending on your Android version). This is the only way to purge in-memory data.
