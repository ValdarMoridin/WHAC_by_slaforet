<b>What's new in 1.5</b><br>
<ul>
<li/>Armies, battles and result files are now saved in sdcard/whac/
<li/>So, you can now handle your armies : copy/cut/paste/transfer/sync files outside of WHAC
<li/>A lot of correction for theme forces : not only have most tiers for Warmachine be corrected from previous errors, 
but they also now provide the bonus text.
<li/>The theme forces now can handle "textual" description of limitations, so you will get something like "non character warjacks" instead of
the complete list of warjacks available.
<li/>And, you can import theme forces files, so you can get new themes and/or corrections the same ways you do with cards.
<li/>You can now save many battle results with the same army list (same list played against various opponents)
<li/>Last, but not least : you can add cards in battle mode (hello popping shredders!) : find the card in the library, then long-press to add to your troops.
</ul>

<b>Please note : </b><br>
Your current army lists will be automatically converted to a new format, and moved to a directory where you can access the files.<br>
Your past battles will be deleted. New battles will be saved in a directory you can access.<br>
Your previous battle results will be deleted (sorry, but there was too much bugs in the results).<br> 
New results will be saved in a directory you can access.
<br>
In short, all new files will be saved under /WHAC sub-directories on your device. You will copy/cut/past/delete them as you wish
using a file explorer. All files are text-based (JSON) so you can edit/review them with any text editor.
