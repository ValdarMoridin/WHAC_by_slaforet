
Special Rules
Mark a zone (12 inch × 6 inch rectangle) and place two Critical Asset objectives in accordance with the diagram below. The objective on Player 1's side of the table is a friendly Faction model to Player 1 and vice versa. Starting on the second player's second turn, at the end of each player's turn a player earns control points (CP) as follows.

    Artifice: Kill Box
    Enemy Objective: Destroyed/Removed from Play = 1 CP (once per objective)
    Zone: Control = 1 CP, Dominate = 2 CP

Victory Conditions

The first player to earn at least 5 control points and have more control points than the opponent immediately wins the game.

If time runs out before a player has won the game via scenario or assassination victory, break the tie as outlined on the Scenario Reference Sheet. For the 3rd tiebreaker, double the army points within the zone.
Only the active player scores when multiple players dominate the same zone or flag
